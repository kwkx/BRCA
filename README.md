# BRCA
The result of BRCA clustering and RGP signature can be found here!

To get the results of RGP score in 10 test sets, you can run the RGP.R file directly. The output of the code is in the "BRCA-main/RGP/survival", "BRCA-main/RGP/ROC","BRCA-main/RGP/RGP score". 
To get the results of clustering in TCGA-BRCA using 65 tumor process related key genes, you can run the cluster.R file directly. The input of the code is a expression file (TCGAdata65.txt) and a clinical data file (TCGAclinical.txt), which are in the "BRCA-main/cluster". The out put of the code is in the "BRCA-main/cluster" too.
